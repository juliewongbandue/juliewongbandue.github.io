			Hey! I'm Julie. Born in Queens, raised in Jersey, and now reside in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I have a BFA in Painting, and have always been a creative person with a penchant for organization and systems. In effort to stay relevant in the workforce, I took General Assembly's Front End Web Development course. After having tasted the possibilities of coding, I'm in it to win it. Web development, here I come.
