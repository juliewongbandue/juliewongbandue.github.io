# Approach Taken!

### We started out trying to think of something we needed, that an app could help us solve. As students, most of our life is dedicated to studying things that would eventually land us a job. So, naturally, a job-search app was the next logical step. We wanted a smooth user experience and maximum functionality without appearing clunky. 

### Though we all have different specialties, we did almost all of our work as a team, ensuring that everyone had a little part in every aspect of the project. This way, we were all able to learn and expand our skillset, especially in areas in which we were less comfortable.

### With the ability to add profile information, search for jobs by location and/or programming language, save favorite jobs and create a to-do list for each favorite job, we feel this will be an excellent application for any coder who is looking for a job.

# Future Plans

### In the future, we would like to add a few extra features that we did not have the time to explore during the time given:

	+ Ability for users to share jobs between their profiles 
	+ Ability to search for other users based on their skills
	+ Job suggestions based on skills/favorite jobs
	+ Reminders to apply for a favorited job after a certain amount of time has passed
	+ Integration of Active Jobs/Active Mailer

Especially when you apply to so many jobs, you forget which ones have gotten back to you! I discovered GitHired and now I used it to keep track of all of the jobs I've applied to with their To-Do list feature. This has been a god-send for my job search. I even got an interview my very first week in using it!" - Margaret, a Ruby Developer from NYC
